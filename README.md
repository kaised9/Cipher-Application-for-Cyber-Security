# Cipher Application : A Simple Tool for Encryption & Decryption

This project is called the **Cipher Application**. It is a simple and useful program built using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for encrypting and decrypting messages securely and interactively.


## Features

- Responsive centered form container with glassmorphism style
- Animated colorful background blobs for a dynamic look
- Clean and readable input fields with focus effects
- Smooth button hover animations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Including Animations &  Flexbox)

## üîê Encryption Algorithms Used

This application supports the following **four well-known encryption algorithms**:

1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions forward in the alphabet.

2. **Vigen√®re Cipher**  
   A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters differently across the message, offering better security than Caesar.

3. **ROT13 Cipher**  
   A special case of Caesar Cipher with a fixed shift of 13. Used to obfuscate text in online forums or casual communication.

4. **Bacon Cipher**  
   An early form of steganography that encodes each letter into a unique sequence of 'A's and 'B's.


## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter text in the input fields and interact with buttons.
4. Enjoy the animated background and stylish UI.

## Customization

- Modify the `.background-text` CSS to change the animated background text content, size, color, or animation speed.
- Adjust background blob colors and animation in the CSS as desired.
- Customize form fields and buttons in the HTML.
